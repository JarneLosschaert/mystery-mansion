    <h2>Mystery Mansion</h2>
    <p class="text">
      In the sprawling mansion of billionaire <span>Johnny</span>, tucked away
      in a big forest, a group of his closest pals gathered for a joyous
      reunion, celebrating his milestone <span>30th birthday</span>. Laughter echoed through
      the halls as they caught up after too long apart, relishing the warmth of
      friendship under the twinkling chandeliers.<br />
      But as dawn broke the following day, the mansion fell into a chilling
      silence. <span>Johnny</span>, the vibrant host of their revelry, lay lifeless in his
      master bedroom. Shock gripped the gathering like a sudden storm. Fear
      spread as they realized: no one had entered or left the mansion through
      the night. Whispers of suspicion raced through their minds. Each friend
      now both a <span>suspect</span> and a seeker of truth, scanning <span>Johnny’s luxurious
      domain</span> for any shred of evidence. Secrets, long buried beneath smiles and
      shared memories, began to surface, exposing hidden motives and unspoken
      desires. As hours turned into tense interrogations and covert
      investigations, the mansion’s glittering facade gave way to a labyrinth of
      uncertainty and doubt.<br />
      The question hung heavy in the stale air: Who among them could have
      silenced <span>Johnny’s laughter</span> forever?
